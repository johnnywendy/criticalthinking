		<stationLongDescription>The MSA provides relevant mission intelligence to DCGS crews and Commanders so they can conduct their mission armed with information vital to their success.  MSAâ€™s gather intelligence from the SIGINT and IMINT crews, their internal partners, and outside Intelligence Agencies, their external partners, and conduct research using various computer resources such as email, internet, chat, or voice.  MSA's also conduct intelligence research in support of DCGS crews and the operational mission.  This intelligence is used to build briefings, storyboards, and intelligence reports for both the mission crews and the squadron commanders.  Sometimes they receive requests for information (RFIs) from forward deployed warfighters and other national agencies.  MSAs process these RFIs and work to answer them in a timely manner.  Within the DCGS, MSAs are commonly imbedded with imagery crews providing current intelligence directly to that mission crew in order to help fill intelligence gaps.   Other MSAs work in a fusion cell, which is strategically positioned on the DCGS Operations Floor in order to be able to provide the co-located Mission Operations Commander (MOC), IMINT crews, and SIGINT crews enhanced real-time mission support.</stationLongDescription>
